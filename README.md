# ROCCurve
Python code to plot an example receiver-operator characteristic curve for a Gaussian distributed signal and background. 

This code produces three plots: Two plots of the signal and background distributions, with the false and true positives shaded, and the corresponding ROC curve and indicated working point. 

The effect of the threshold, signal and background rates on the ROC curve performance can be studied using this.
